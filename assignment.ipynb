        "2. Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing?\n",
